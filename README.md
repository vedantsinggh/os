# Minimal x86 Operating System (unnamed yet)

This is a simple 32-bit x86 operating system built from scratch. It includes a basic bootloader written in assembly, a kernel written in C++, and a linker script to define the memory layout. The final output is a bootable ISO image which can be run using QEMU or other emulators.
